* Capture tmux window

~tmux~ has ~capture-pane~ command, but there is no command to capture (i.e. screenshot) a whole tmux window.

This script does that for you.

#+begin_src
# Capture window
tmux-capture-window > sav

# View captured content
tmux-capture-window -l sav

# Enable color (not perfect)
tmux-capture-window -e > sav
tmux-capture-window -e -l sav

# Capture other window
tmux-capture-window -t '@2' > sav
#+end_src

** Help
#+begin_src
Usage: tmux-capture-window [-e -h] [-t TARGET] [-l JSON]
Options:
  -e            Enable escape sequences
  -l JSON       Load and view saved json
  -t TARGET     Target window
  -h            Help
